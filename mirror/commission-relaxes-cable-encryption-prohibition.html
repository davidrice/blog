<p><b>INTRODUCTION </b></p>
1. With this Report and Order (Order), we amend our rules to allow cable operators to encrypt <br>
the basic service tier in all-digital cable systems if they comply with certain consumer-protection <br>measures.  As discussed below, this rule change will benefit consumers who can have their cable service <br>activated and deactivated from a remote location. By allowing remote activation and deactivation, we <br>expect our amended rules will result in benefits to both cable operators and consumers by significantly <br>reducing the number of truck rolls associated with provisioning service and significantly reducing the <br>need for subscribers to wait for service calls to activate or deactivate cable service.  At the same time, we <br>recognize that this rule change will adversely affect a small number of cable subscribers who currently <br>view the digital basic service tier without using a set-top box or other equipment.  If a cable operator <br>decides to encrypt the digital basic tier, then these subscribers will need equipment to continue viewing <br>the channels on this tier.  To give those consumers time to resolve the incompatibility between consumer <br>electronics equipment (such as digital television sets) and newly encrypted cable service, we require <br>operators of cable systems that choose to encrypt the basic service tier to comply with certain consumer <br>protection measures for a period of time.  In addition, we note that this rule change may impact the ability <br>of a small number of subscribers that use certain third-party equipment that is not CableCARD <br>compatible to access channels on the basic service tier.  To address this issue, we require the six largest <br>incumbent cable operators to comply with additional requirements that are intended to ensure <br>compatibility with certain third-party-provided equipment used to access the basic tier.<br>

<p><b>BACKGROUND </b></p>
2. In the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 (“1992 Cable <br>
Act”), Congress sought to make sure that consumer electronics equipment could receive cable <br>programming and that compatibility issues did not limit the premium features of that equipment.  Section  <br>17 of that law added Section 624A to the Communications Act of 1934, as amended.1 Section 624A <br>requires the Commission to issue regulations to assure compatibility between consumer electronics <br>equipment and cable systems.2 In 1994, the Commission implemented the requirements of Section 624A <br>in part by adding Section 76.630(a) to its rules.3 Section 76.630(a) prohibits cable operators from <br>scrambling or encrypting signals carried on the basic tier of service.4 Encryption is an essential <br>component of a conditional access system, which cable operators use to ensure that subscribers receive <br>only the services that they are authorized to receive.5 Nevertheless, the Commission determined that this <br>rule would significantly advance compatibility by ensuring that all subscribers would be able to receive <br>basic tier signals “in the clear” and that basic-only subscribers with cable-ready televisions would not <br>need set-top boxes.6 The Commission concluded that “[t]his rule also will have minimal impact on the <br>

4 47 C.F.R. § 76.630(a).  Section 76.630(a), in pertinent part, provides that “[c]able system operators shall not <br>scramble or otherwise encrypt signals carried on the basic service tier.  Requests for waivers of this prohibition must <br>demonstrate either a substantial problem with theft of basic tier service or a strong need to scramble basic signals for <br>other reasons.” <i>Id.</i><br>
5 <i>Nondiscrimination in Distribution of Interactive Television Services Over Cable</i>, 16 FCC Rcd 1321, 1332, n.27 <br>(2001).  Encryption is defined as “the transformation of data into a form unreadable by anyone without a secret <br>encryption key.”  <i>See </i>H. Newton, <i>Newton’s Telecom Dictionary </i>300 (20th ed. 2004).<br>

cable industry in view of the fact that most cable systems now generally do not scramble basic tier <br>signals.”7<br>
3. In the mid-1990’s, cable operators began to upgrade their systems to offer digital cable <br>
service in addition to analog cable service (hybrid service).8 More recently, many cable operators have <br>transitioned to more efficient all-digital service, freeing up spectrum to offer new or improved products <br>and services like higher-speed Internet access and high definition programming.9 After a cable operator <br>transitions to an all-digital system, most of its subscribers have at least one cable set-top box or retail <br>CableCARD10 device in their homes.11 We expect that the percentage of homes with set-top boxes or <br>retail CableCARD devices will continue to increase as more cable operators eliminate analog service <br>from their systems in favor of more efficient digital service.12<br>
4. The percentage of homes with set-top boxes or CableCARD devices is high because most <br>
cable systems now scramble most of their signals.  As cable operators began to transition programming <br>on their cable programming service tier (“CPST”)13 to digital, many program carriage agreements <br>

10 CableCARD devices are devices that can access linear digital cable service when paired with a CableCARD.  <i>See<br>Implementation of Section 304 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996:  Commercial Availability of Navigation <br>Devices; Compatibility Between Cable Systems and Consumer Electronics Equipment</i>, 18 FCC Rcd 20885 (2003).  <br><i>See also infra</i>, note 14 explaining the CableCARD standard.  Some CableCARD devices, such as the TiVo digital <br>video recorder and the Ceton InfiniTV 4 tuner for personal computers are available for purchase at retail.  Others, <br>such as the set-top boxes produced by Motorola Mobility and Cisco, are only available for lease from a cable <br>operator.  <i>Implementation of Section 304 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996:  Commercial Availability of <br>Navigation Devices</i>, 25 FCC Rcd 14657 (2010).<br>
11 <i>See </i>Ian Olgeirson, Mari Rondeli, and Michelle Ow, <i>Q3 video subscriber trends improve but still lack real <br>strength</i>, MULTICHANNEL MARKET TRENDS (SNL Kagan, Charlottesville, VA), Nov. 16, 2011, <i>available at<br></i><a title="http://www.snl.com/interactivex/article.aspx?id=13666901&amp;KPLT=6" href="http://www.snl.com/interactivex/article.aspx?id=13666901&amp;KPLT=6">http://www.snl.com/interactivex/article.aspx?id=13666901&amp;KPLT=6</a> (reporting that 78.3 percent of cable <br>subscribers are digital subscribers, which would necessitate a set-top box or CableCARD).  Some consumers <br>currently use devices with QAM tuners to receive digital service without a set-top box or CableCARD to view <br>unencrypted basic service tier programming, but data that Cablevision filed with the Media Bureau indicates that the <br>number of subscribers in this category is extremely limited, <i>e.g., </i>only one-tenth of one percent of subscribers.  <i>See<br></i>Cablevision Reply, MB Docket No. 08-168, at 1-2 (filed Nov. 16, 2009) (reporting that Cablevision has more than <br>700,000 subscribers in New York City); Letter from Michael E. Olsen, Senior Vice President, Legal Regulatory and <br>Legislative Affairs, Cablevision Systems Corporation, to Marlene H. Dortch, Secretary, Federal Communications <br>Commission, MB Docket No. 09-168 (Aug. 11, 2011) (reporting that Cablevision deployed 739 free set-top boxes to <br>basic service tier subscribers as a condition of its basic service tier encryption waiver, representing roughly one-<br>tenth of one percent of Cablevision’s subscribers in New York City).  <i>See also infra</i>, n. 21 (defining “QAM”). <br>
12 <i>See </i>BendBroadband Comments at 4 (reporting that set-top boxes are in 100 percent of BendBroadband’s <br>subscribers’ homes, up from 55 percent before BendBroadband’s transition to all-digital service); Comcast <br>Comments at 3-4 (announcing Comcast’s goal of transitioning at least 50 percent of its footprint to all-digital <br>service); TWC Comments at 2-3 (describing an all-digital conversion pilot project in Augusta, Maine).<br>
13 On most cable systems, the basic service tier includes broadcast stations and public access services, whereas the <br>CPST generally includes other popular non-broadcast programming services.  <i>See TCR Sports Broadcasting <br>Holding, L.L.P. d/b/a Mid-Atlantic Sports Network v.

required cable operators to encrypt that programming as a condition of carriage.14 In addition, cable <br>operators use encryption as part of their conditional access system to ensure that cable service is available <br>only to those who have paid for it.15 Particular methods of encryption, however, vary across cable <br>systems, which could lead to incompatibility between consumer devices and cable service.16 In 2003, the <br>Commission adopted the CableCARD standard to address this incompatibility problem.17 The <br>CableCARD, which subscribers must lease from their cable provider either as a part of a leased set-top <br>box or separately for use in a compatible retail television or set-top box,18 decrypts the cable services.  At <br>present, over 78 percent of all cable subscribers have at least one leased set-top box or retail CableCARD <br>device in their home.19 Cable operators who offer only digital service indicate that all of their subscribers <br>have at least one leased set-top box or retail CableCARD device.20 Some cable subscribers rely on QAM <br>
 <br>
 <br>
14 “Many cable program networks want to require cable operators to encrypt all of their signals, including standard <br>definition digital signals. Doing so would require [a CableCARD or set-top box for use with] every single digital TV <br>set.”  Letter from Mark Palchick, Counsel to Massillon Cable TV, to Marlene H. Dortch, Secretary, Federal <br>Communications Commission, CSR-7229-Z, CS Docket No. 97-80, at Attachment at 7 (July 31, 2009).  <i>See also<br></i>Montgomery County, Maryland Reply, MB Docket No. 10-91, at 9 (filed Aug. 12, 2010) (“The majority of cable <br>operators now encrypt all but their broadcast channels and PEG access channels.”).<br>
15 Historically, cable operators have prevented subscribers from receiving signals to which they do not subscribe <br>through the use of physical “traps”  installed between the subscriber’s equipment and the cable operator’s plant, <br>which block or scramble a signal.  WALTER CICIORA ET AL, MODERN CABLE TELEVISION TECHNOLOGY 824-6 (2d <br>ed. Morgan Kaufmann Publishers 2004).  Digital encryption technology, in contrast, allows a cable operator to <br>change the services that a subscriber receives without visiting the subscriber’s home and is more effective at <br>preventing unauthorized access to content.  <i>Id</i>. at 875-892.<br>
16 In the late 1990s, the Commission recognized that this diversity in encryption techniques could present a barrier to <br>compatibility between retail devices and cable services because consumer electronics manufacturers could not build <br>complex, system-specific decryption technology into their devices, and cable operators did not wish to entrust <br>consumer electronics manufacturers with the complex encryption algorithms used to protect cable content.  <br><i>Implementation of Section 304 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996:  Commercial Availability of Navigation <br>Devices</i>, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 12 FCC Rcd 5639, 5653-7, ¶¶ 30-36 (1997).<br>
17 <i>Implementation of Section 304 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996:  Commercial Availability of Navigation <br>Devices; Compatibility Between Cable Systems and Consumer Electronics Equipment</i>, 18 FCC Rcd 20885 (2003).  <br>The CableCARD standard separates the encryption function from all other functions of a television or set-top box; <br>the CableCARD is designed to decrypt the system-specific encryption and re-encrypt the signal into the nationally <br>supported dynamic feedback arrangement scrambling technique (DFAST).  <i>Id</i>.  This permits consumer electronics <br>device manufacturers to build nationally portable devices that are compatible with cable systems nationwide.  <i>Id</i>.  <br>
18 Retail CableCARD devices (such as set-top boxes, computer peripherals, and television sets) come without<br>CableCARDs installed; subscribers who purchase such devices must lease the CableCARD from the cable operator <br>and install it in the device in order to view encrypted programming.  <i>See id.</i>; <i>Implementation of Section 304 of the <br>Telecommunications Act of 1996:  Commercial Availability of Navigation Devices</i>, 25 FCC Rcd 14657 (2010).  <br>Leased set-top boxes usually come with the CableCARD preinstalled by the manufacturer.  <i>Implementation of <br>Section 304 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996:  Commercial Availability of Navigation Devices</i>, 25 FCC Rcd <br>14657, 14660-1, ¶ 5 (2010).<br>

tuners21 in television sets and consumer electronics devices that allow access to unencrypted digital cable <br>service without additional equipment,22 but, based on the record before us, we believe that few consumers <br>rely on them for primary access to cable service.23  The fact that most cable subscribers already have a <br>cable set-top box or retail CableCARD device significantly reduces the number of subscribers who <br>benefit from the prohibition on encryption of the basic service tier in all-digital systems in contrast to <br>systems that carry analog service.24  <br>
5. Our rules state that requests for waiver of the encryption prohibition “must demonstrate either <br>
a substantial problem with theft of basic tier service or a strong need to scramble basic signals for other <br>reasons.”25 Prior to 2010, the Commission had waived the rule based only on theft of service.26 Recently, <br>the Commission has received several requests for waiver of the rule prohibiting encryption of the basic <br>service tier based on the argument that the rule imposes more burdens than benefits as cable operators <br>transition to all-digital systems.27 The petitioners argue that there are very few people who subscribe only <br>to the basic service tier in all-digital systems, and that access to the basic tier would therefore be <br>unaffected by encryption for the overwhelming majority of subscribers to such systems because they <br>
 <br>
 <br>
21 “QAM” refers to quadrature amplitude modulation, the modulation technique that cable operators use to transmit <br>data using traditional 6 MHz RF channels.  CICIORA ET AL, <i>supra </i>note 15, at 12 (2d ed. Morgan Kaufmann <br>Publishers 2004).  This technique is analogous to the 8-VSB modulation technique that over-the-air broadcast <br>television uses to transmit data.  <i>Id. </i>at 137-81.  Section 15.117(i) of the Commission’s rules requires all television <br>reception devices shipped in interstate commerce to include digital television (DTV) tuners.  47 C.F.R. § 15.117(i) <br>(setting forth an implementation schedule for devices to include DTV tuners and stating that as of March 1, 2007 all <br>television reception devices shipped in interstate commerce must include DTV tuners). Many devices that include <br>digital tuners can receive both QAM signals transmitted by cable operators and 8-VSB signals transmitted by <br>broadcast stations.  <i>See The FCC's Office of Engineering and Technology Releases Report on Tests of Prototype TV <br>White Space Devices</i>, 23 FCC Rcd 16007, 16046 (2008).<br>
22 We understand, anecdotally, that these devices often are non-primary devices in households, such as television <br>sets in guest rooms and kitchens.<br>
23 <i>See supra </i>n.11.  <br>24 We note that a limited number of subscribers in all-digital homes may use second or third television sets to access <br>unencrypted digital basic service tier service without set-top boxes or CableCARDs, but data that Cablevision filed <br>with the Media Bureau suggests that the number of subscribers in this category is relatively small, because few <br>people took advantage of free equipment offered to subscribers that accessed digital basic service without set-top <br>boxes or CableCARDs.  Letter from Michael E. Olsen, Senior Vice President, Legal Regulatory and Legislative <br>Affairs, Cablevision Systems Corporation, to Marlene H. Dortch, Secretary, Federal Communications Commission, <br>MB Docket No. 09-168 (Aug. 11, 2011).<br>
25 47 C.F.R. § 76.630(a).<br>26 <i>See Liberty Cablevision of Puerto Rico, Inc. Petition for Waiver of Section 76.630(a) Basic Tier Scrambling</i>, 15 <br>FCC Rcd 15064 (CSB 2000); <i>Centennial Puerto Rico Cable TV Corp. Petition for Waiver of Section 76.630(a) <br>Basic Tier Scrambling</i>, 18 FCC Rcd. 7736 (MB 2003).  Theft of service occurs when unauthorized users physically <br>connect their outlets to the cable plant.  For example, people would climb poles and connect the cable operator’s <br>coaxial cable to homes that do not subscribe to cable service.  <i>See Liberty Cablevision of Puerto Rico, Inc. Petition <br>for Waiver of Section 76.630(a) Basic Tier Scrambling</i>, 15 FCC Rcd 15064, 15065-6, ¶¶ 5-6 (MB 2000).  Cable <br>operators combat the theft problem by educating consumers, penalizing offenders, pursuing civil actions, and <br>assisting law enforcement officials in criminal actions.  <i>Id. </i>at 15065, ¶ 3.<br>

already have a set-top box or CableCARD-equipped retail device.28 Furthermore, they contend, <br>encrypting the basic service tier in an all-digital system would eliminate the need for many service calls <br>because it would allow cable operators to enable and disable cable service remotely, activating and <br>deactivating the encryption capability of set-top boxes and CableCARDs from the headend rather than <br>visiting subscribers’ homes.29 Today, cable operators typically must manually connect and disconnect the <br>cable that runs to a home to activate or deactivate service and use traps to block access to particular <br>channels.30 If the cable operator were allowed to encrypt every signal, the operator could keep every <br>home connected to the cable plant regardless of whether the home subscribes to cable service.  In <br>addition, the operator could ensure that only paid subscribers are able to access the service by authorizing <br>and deauthorizing CableCARDs, or other legitimate devices, as people subscribe to or cancel cable <br>service.31  <br>
6. In January 2010, the Media Bureau granted a conditional waiver of the rule that prohibits <br>
encryption of the basic service tier to Cablevision with respect to Cablevision’s New York City systems, <br>which are all-digital.32 The Bureau based its decision on the fact that encryption of the basic service tier <br>on Cablevision’s all-digital systems would allow Cablevision to enable and disable cable service <br>remotely.33 The Bureau also found that remote activation and deactivation of cable service would <br>“reduce[] costs for Cablevision, improve[] customer service, and reduce[] fuel consumption and CO2<br>emissions.”34 Remote activation and deactivation, the Bureau concluded, would reduce installation costs <br>for Cablevision’s subscribers and also benefit these subscribers by reducing the number of occasions <br>when they must wait at home for a service call, as compared to unencrypted cable systems.35 The Bureau <br>reasoned that Cablevision would sufficiently address the problem of incompatibility with consumer <br>electronics “by providing basic-only subscribers with set-top boxes or CableCARDs without charge for <br>significant periods of time.”36 Finally, the Bureau also concluded that the waiver would “provide an <br>

 <br>
28 <i>See RCN Request </i>at 1-2.<br>29 <i>Id</i>. at 6-7.<br>30 <i>See supra</i>, n.15.<br>31 Without the CableCARD, which is necessary to decrypt the service, a device cannot decrypt and display any <br>encrypted signals it receives.  Therefore, if all signals are encrypted, cable operators can send cable signals into <br>every home passed without allowing non-subscribers to access the service. While cable operators cannot activate <br>service instantaneously – subscribers will need to obtain CableCARDs or set-top boxes from their providers to <br>receive service – delivery of CableCARDs or set-top boxes to and from subscribers is much easier logistically than <br>scheduling an appointment with consumers to connect or disconnect a specific home.  <i>See </i>Cablevision Request at 4 <br>(“Customers could pick up a digital set-top box at a walk-in center or have it shipped directly to their home, plug in <br>the digital box for any level of service, and enjoy it immediately, without waiting for a service appointment to install <br>or reactivate a drop.”).  We note that as of November 1, 2011, our rules require all cable operators to allow self-<br>installation of CableCARDs in devices, provided that the device manufacturer or vendor includes appropriate <br>installation instructions and a manned toll-free telephone number to answer installation questions.  47 C.F.R. § <br>76.1205(b)(1); <i>Implementation of Section 304 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996:  Commercial Availability of <br>Navigation Devices</i>, 25 FCC Rcd 14657, 14669-14673, ¶¶ 20-29 (2010).<br>

Project for the Commission to deal with the basic service tier encryption issue by launching a rulemaking <br>proceeding,40 the Commission issued a <i>Notice of Proposed Rulemaking </i>in October 2011.41 The <br>Commission proposed to allow cable operators to encrypt the basic service tier in all-digital systems, <br>subject to conditions that would minimize disruption for affected subscribers by providing a transition <br>period in which to make informed choices about purchasing or leasing new equipment to continue <br>accessing service.42 Based on the reports that Cablevision submitted as a condition of its waiver, the <br>Commission in the <i>Encryption NPRM </i>predicted that the rule change would reduce truck rolls and service <br>calls with modest adverse effects on few subscribers.43 We received comments or reply comments on the <br><i>Encryption NPRM </i>from 34 parties, and a number of subsequent ex parte filings.  The parties’ positions <br>are described in the ensuing Discussion.<br>

operators to activate and deactivate cable service remotely, thus relieving many consumers of the need to <br>schedule appointments when they sign up for or cancel cable service.  In addition, encryption will reduce <br>the number of truck rolls necessary for manual installations and disconnections, reduce service theft, and <br>establish regulatory parity between cable operators and their satellite competitors, who are not subject to <br>the encryption rule.  We find these benefits offset the increased burdens that may result from encryption <br>of the basic service tier.  Recognizing, as noted above, that some consumers rely on unencrypted basic tier <br>service, we adopt narrowly tailored consumer protection measures to help ease the transition to encrypted <br>service for those consumers.  In the sections below, we first discuss which systems will be allowed to<br>encrypt the basic service tier.  Then we discuss the benefits associated with permitting all-digital cable <br>operators to encrypt the basic service tier, as well as the burdens associated with our rule change and <br>consumer protection measures we adopt to mitigate those burdens.  Finally, we discuss the legal basis for <br>the rule changes.<br>
<p><b>A.</b></p>
<p><b>Systems Eligible to Encrypt </b></p>
9. In the <i>Encryption NPRM</i>, the Commission proposed to allow encryption of the basic service <br>
tier only with respect to all-digital systems “because remote activation and deactivation of cable service, <br>and its attendant benefits, are only feasible in all-digital systems.”45 For this reason, we limit encryption <br>eligibility of the basic tier to all-digital systems.  The Commission proposed to define an “all-digital”46<br>system as one in which “no television signals are provided using the NTSC system.”47 As explained <br>below, we adopt our proposed definition, finding that it will best achieve our goal of facilitating remote <br>activation and deactivation of cable service “while minimizing interference with the special functions of <br>subscribers’ television sets.”48<br>
10. Commenters suggested several substantive changes to our proposed rule.  Several <br>
commenters suggested that we extend encryption eligibility to cable operators that offer unencrypted <br>analog “barker channels.”49 Mikrotec and Inter Mountain Cable suggested that operators should be <br>allowed to encrypt the basic service tier as long as all “programming”50 on the basic tier is transmitted<br>digitally and “if that condition is met, then there should be no concern that the system otherwise uses <br>analog modulation.”51  They also suggest that eligibility to encrypt should be determined subscriber-by-<br>
 <br>
 <br>
45 <i>Encryption NPRM</i>, 26 FCC Rcd at 14877, ¶ 9 (2011).  Public Knowledge and Media Access Project note in their <br>comments that remote activation and deactivation are technically feasible if the cable operator does not encrypt any <br>of its analog programming and delivers all of that programming to every house regardless of whether the house <br>subscribes.  PK and MAP Comments at 13.  Nothing in our current rules would prevent an operator from delivering <br>unencrypted all tiers of service if they wanted to, but no commenter suggested that cable operators want to deliver <br>all analog programming unencrypted—delivering program unencrypted increases the chance for theft of service.   <br>

49 NCTA Comments at 10-11; Eric Kotz Comments at 3; Comcast Comments at 8, n.19; ACA Reply at 11.  NCTA <br>explains that cable operators may transmit “analog barker channels explaining how to subscribe or promoting digital <br>services, and may even combine locally-inserted informational channels.”  NCTA Comments at 10.  The term <br>“barker channel” generally refers to menu, directory, or promotional video channels.  <i>See Implementation of <br>Sections of the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992:  Rate Regulation</i>, 9 FCC Rcd <br>4119, 4157, n.118 (1994); Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc. v.

subscriber, not on a system-by-system basis, because cable operators may elect to transition portions of <br>systems to all-digital piecemeal, and the rule should not discourage that practice.  <br>
11. We believe the best criterion for eligibility to encrypt the basic service tier is that the system <br>
carries only digital signals aside from unencrypted analog barker channels.  Encryption on hybrid systems <br>(that is, systems that transmit signals in analog and digital) would not generate the benefits associated <br>with encryption on all-digital systems because the analog portion of the system will still require truck <br>rolls to activate and deactivate service and the Commission does not have a separated security solution <br>like CableCARD to ensure that retail devices can access scrambled analog cable programming. 52  <br>Therefore, permitting hybrid systems to encrypt would not result in the type of benefits that justify easing <br>the encryption requirement for all-digital systems.  We do not believe that it is practical to adopt Mikrotec <br>and Inter Mountain Cable’s proposal to determine eligibility for encryption on a consumer-by-consumer <br>basis,53 because encryption disparity on a consumer-by-consumer basis could lead to consumer confusion:  <br>under this proposal, one subscriber could be subject to encryption (and the commensurate consumer-<br>protection measures described below), while his neighbor could face no encryption and be able to access <br>channels on the basic service tier.  The administrative burdens of determining the applicability of the rule <br>would also make such a proposal unreasonable.  Therefore, we believe that our rule, which determines <br>eligibility for encryption on a system-wide basis, is more reasonable and will better serve the public <br>interest.54  <br>
<p><b>B.</b></p>
<p><b>Benefits of Permitting Basic Service Tier Encryption</b></p>
12. <i>Remote Activation and Deactivation</i>.  Based on examination of the record, we are persuaded <br>
that allowing encryption of the basic service tier on all-digital systems will reduce the need for many <br>consumers to schedule a service call and wait for the cable technician to arrive before initiating or <br>terminating their cable service. ACA states in its comments that physical connection and disconnection <br>of cable service in all-digital systems is “unnecessary but for the existence of the basic service tier <br>encryption prohibition.”55 Comcast predicts that encrypting the basic service tier will allow the company <br>to perform nearly half of its activations and 90 percent of its deactivations remotely.56 Cablevision <br>
 <br>
 <br>
52 Public Knowledge and Media Access Project propose that hybrid systems (systems that carry analog and digital <br>video programming) should be eligible to encrypt if (1) the operator does not encrypt any channels it provides via <br>analog transmission, and (2) the operator uses remote activation and does not require a service visit to begin service.  <br>PK &amp; MAP Comments at 13.  We do not believe that this approach would be any different in practice than the rule <br>we adopt, which prohibits hybrid systems from encrypting the basic service tier, because no operator would be able <br>to meet the second criterion.  As Cablevision explains in its comments, remote activation is not feasible for every <br>new subscriber until every home has an active and encrypted connection to the cable network, which would not be <br>the case for the analog portion of the hybrid system.  Cablevision Comments at 12-13.  To the extent that digital <br>service is encrypted but the operator also provides an analog barker channel that is unencrypted, the operator is still <br>able to remotely activate and deactivate service.<br>
53 Mikrotec and Inter Mountain Cable suggest that we allow encryption when “[n]o television programming is <br>provided <i>to the subscriber </i>using the NTSC system.”  Mikrotec and Intermountain Cable Comments at 8 (emphasis <br>added).  <br>
54 As discussed below, as a consumer-protection measure, we will require cable operators that choose to encrypt to <br>notify all subscribers about encryption of the basic service tier and to offer them free set-top boxes for a period of <br>time.  <i>See infra </i>¶¶ 16-24.<br>
55 ACA Comments at 3; <i>see also </i>Public Knowledge Comments at 4-5, Comcast Comments at 4-6.<br>56 Comcast Comments at 6-7. Comcast explained that, “[r]emote service activations are likely to be commonplace in <br>situations where a new customer is signing up for cable service that involves a simple connection of a set-top box or <br>CableCARD-enabled device to a TV set, or connecting a cable modem for high-speed Internet service to a single PC <br>or laptop.”  Letter from Jonathan Friedman, Counsel for Comcast Corporation, to Marlene H. Dortch, Secretary, <br>Federal Communications Commission, MB Docket No. 11-169 (Jan. 20, 2012).  Consumers who subscribe to <br>

reports that, since it received waiver of the encryption prohibition, 99.5 percent of its deactivations were <br>performed remotely and a growing number of its new customers are eligible for remote activation.57 The <br>result for consumers is that in many cases they will no longer need to rearrange their schedules to wait for <br>cable technicians to arrive at their homes in order to activate and deactivate their cable service, making <br>activation and deactivation of service much more convenient.58<br>
13. In addition to the projected time savings for subscribers because of remote activation and <br>
deactivation, the record is replete with secondary benefits that cable operators and their customers will <br>realize as a result of remote service change.  These include savings for cable operators because of a <br>reduction in the need to dispatch service technicians to customers’ homes.  For example, commenters <br>assert that reduced costs due to truck rolls and system maintenance will save cable operators money that <br>they can use to “invest in innovative new products that customers demand and highly value.”59 In <br>addition, Comcast states that, with remote activation and deactivation, “technicians would need to access <br>drop lines less frequently, thereby reducing ‘wear-and-tear’ on the lines and the need for maintenance.”60  <br>Many commenters also highlight the benefits remote activation and deactivation will have on vehicle <br>traffic and the environment.61  Microtek and Inter Mountain Cable even suggest that these increased <br>efficiencies could lead to lower rates for subscribers.62  <br>

57Cablevision Comments at 12; Cablevision Reply at 1.  Cablevision indicates that as of October 2011, the <br>percentage of households eligible for a “truckless reconnect” reached nearly 40 percent of all new and transferred <br>connections, and that “Cablevision is expanding the opportunities for consumers to self-install services.”  Letter <br>from Christopher J. Hardie, Counsel for Cablevision Systems Corporation, to Marlene H. Dortch, Secretary, Federal <br>Communications Commission, MB Docket No. 11-169 (Jan. 24, 2012).

A recent survey by TOA Technologies estimates that the cost of the time spent waiting for <br>in-home service from cable, satellite, telephone, utility and other service providers amounts to $37.7 billion per year.  <br>TOA Technologies, 2011 Cost of Waiting Survey, United States Results 5, 7-8, <i>available at<br></i><a title="http://toatech.com/costofwaiting/documents/TOA-Cost-of-Waiting-US_2011.pdf" href="http://toatech.com/costofwaiting/documents/TOA-Cost-of-Waiting-US_2011.pdf">http://toatech.com/costofwaiting/documents/TOA-Cost-of-Waiting-US_2011.pdf</a> (2011).

14. <i>Reduction of Theft and Piracy</i>.  Another benefit of basic tier encryption is the likely reduction <br>
in theft of cable service.63 In 2004, NCTA estimated that five percent of homes passed receive <br>unauthorized cable service, which equates to five billion dollars in unrealized revenue that cable operators <br>could dedicate to offering improved services.64 The resulting reduction in cable operator revenues may<br>increase the rates operators charge their subscribers.65 In addition, Comcast explains that theft of service <br>reduces the quality of cable service because thieves sometimes access the cable system by splitting cables <br>and adding unauthorized taps, which degrade connections and can lead to signal leakage and lower <br>broadband speeds.66 This unauthorized splicing also can add to wear-and-tear on the cable system and <br>increase the need for maintenance.67  Encryption of the basic service tier will discourage thieves from <br>splicing cable lines as it will not enable viewing of the signals without leasing an authorized set-top box <br>or CableCARD from the operator.  Encryption of the basic service tier could also benefit channels that are <br>carried on the basic service tier, as developers of high-value content may be more willing to make the <br>content available to basic service tier channels if they are encrypted and less susceptible to piracy.68<br>
15. <i>Regulatory Parity</i>.  Several commenters emphasized that the proposed rule change will <br>
increase regulatory parity between cable operators and satellite providers, which are not subject to the <br>encryption rule.69 Commenters explain that the technology and market landscapes were quite different <br>when the rule was adopted, when consumers had a reasonable expectation that they would be able to <br>connect their televisions directly to a coaxial cable without the need for a set-top box.70 In the years since <br>enactment of the 1992 Cable Act, consumer expectations have changed substantially.

operators have introduced new and innovative services, such as video on demand and pay-per-view <br>services, that cannot be accessed by digital subscribers without an authorized set-top box or, in some <br>instances, a CableCARD.71 As a result, almost all digital subscribers already use set-top boxes or <br>CableCARDs to access cable service.72 Second, since the 1992 Cable Act, satellite television operators <br>have begun to offer video programming services to tens of millions of subscribers,73 who access these <br>services through the use of one or more converter boxes.  Our rules do not prohibit satellite operators <br>from encrypting their services, and therefore they are able to make service changes remotely and in real <br>time.  Cable operators argue that this puts them at a regulatory disadvantage vis-à-vis their competitors <br>that are not constrained by the requirements of Section 76.630(a).74 We believe that by amending our <br>encryption rule we will reduce this regulatory disparity and enable all-digital cable operators to provide a <br>similar level of customer service as their MVPD competitors.<br>

16. Although we expect our rule change will affect relatively few subscribers,75 we nonetheless <br>
adopt consumer protection measures to mitigate any resulting harm to subscribers who are impacted by <br>encryption of the digital basic tier.  This rule change will impact the few digital cable subscribers who <br>access the basic service tier without a set-top box or CableCARD76:  they will need to obtain a set-top box <br>

or CableCARD from their cable operator once the operator encrypts the basic service tier.  To give these <br>consumers time to assess their options to access encrypted cable service, we will require cable operators <br>that choose to encrypt to offer affected subscribers equipment necessary to receive the encrypted <br>programming without charge for a limited time, and to notify their subscribers about encryption and the <br>equipment offers.  In addition, we require the six largest incumbent cable operators to offer equipment <br>that is compatible with IP-enabled clear-QAM devices provided by third parties.  We intend that this <br>requirement will provide an opportunity for affected consumers to make informed choices about whether <br>to purchase a CableCARD-compatible device, lease a set-top box from their cable operator, or use <br>another method to access the broadcast and other channels carried on the basic service tier (for example, <br>by accessing the signals over-the-air or via another MVPD).  As we explained in the <i>Encryption NPRM</i>, <br>such an opportunity will minimize the impact of encryption on clear-QAM users by offering a transition <br>period during which they can continue to access the basic tier without an additional equipment charge <br>while they consider their options for device compatibility.77 In this section, we identify the small class of <br>subscribers that encryption may affect and adopt two categories of measures to protect those subscribers:  <br>transitional equipment requirements and notice requirements.    <br>
17. <i>Subscribers That May Be Affected by Encryption of the BST. </i>The Commission concluded in <br>
1994 that adopting the basic service tier encryption prohibition “will have minimal impact on the cable <br>industry in view of the fact that most cable systems now generally do not scramble basic tier signals.”78  <br>Today our examination of the record reflects that relaxing the encryption prohibition for all-digital <br>systems will have minimal impact on consumers because most subscribers do not rely on the clear-QAM <br>tuners in their devices to access basic tier signals.79 Nevertheless, we recognize that lifting the encryption <br>prohibition may impact some cable subscribers who use clear-QAM devices to access the basic tier, such<br>as subscribers who use second or third television sets to access unencrypted digital basic service tier <br>service without set-top boxes or CableCARDs and subscribers that use third-party provided IP-enabled<br>devices that have clear-QAM tuners.  Several cable subscribers and equipment manufacturers filed <br>comments claiming that our rule change would have a negative impact on them.80 These subscribers <br>explain that they rely on clear-QAM tuners in their electronic devices (such as computers and television <br>sets) to access basic tier programming, and that because they have more than two devices on which to <br>view BST programming (<i>e.g.</i>, they have multiple televisions in their home), their monthly bills will <br>

Local franchising authorities also filed comments suggesting that the proposed rule change <br>will affect many more subscribers than the Commission predicts because many subscribers will need boxes for non-<br>primary television sets.  <i>See</i>, <i>e.g</i>., City of Boston Comments at 4-5; Montgomery County, MD Comments at 2-3; <br>New Jersey Division of Rate Counsel Comments at 6.  As Comcast responds in its reply, however, these local <br>franchising authorities conflate digitization and encryption—once a system is all-digital, nearly all of the subscribers <br>in that system will have decryption equipment regardless of whether the system encrypts because (i) that equipment <br>is also used to convert digital service into an analog signal, and (ii) that equipment is necessary to view any <br>programming aside from the basic service tier on any television set.  Comcast Reply at 10.  Therefore we expect the <br>impact of basic service tier encryption to be very limited in scope.  <br>

increase because they will need a greater number of converter boxes than afforded under the free box <br>conditions that the Commission proposed in the <i>Encryption NPRM</i>.81  We are concerned about the effect <br>of this rule change on the small group of subscribers who access unencrypted basic service tier <br>programming through clear-QAM receivers, but, at the same time, recognize that no consumer protection <br>measure could fully satisfy every affected subscriber.  Nonetheless, we believe that the consumer-<br>protection measures outlined below are appropriate and necessary to minimize disruption to affected <br>subscribers by providing a reasonable transition period to make informed choices about the options <br>available to access the basic tier.<br>
18. <i>Transitional Equipment Requirements Applicable to All Cable Operators</i>.  To limit the costs <br>
that affected consumers may face due to encryption, we adopt our proposed consumer-protection <br>measures that require a cable operator that chooses to encrypt the basic service tier to:  (i) offer to existing <br>subscribers who subscribe only to the basic service tier and do not use a set-top box or CableCARD, the <br>subscriber’s choice of a set-top box or CableCARD on up to two television sets without charge for two <br>years from the date of encryption; (ii) offer existing subscribers who subscribe to a level of service above <br>“basic only” but use an additional television set to access only the basic service tier without the use of a <br>set-top box or CableCARD at the time of encryption, the subscriber’s choice of a set-top box or <br>CableCARD on one television set without charge for one year from the date of encryption; and (iii) offer <br>existing subscribers who receive Medicaid,82 subscribe only to the basic service tier, and do not use a set-<br>top box or CableCARD, the subscriber’s choice of a set-top box or CableCARD on up to two television <br>sets without charge for five years from the date of encryption.  These consumer protections apply to <br>televisions and devices connected to the cable system at the time of encryption.  To ensure that any<br>subscriber likely to be affected by encryption has adequate time to consider these offers, we will require <br>cable operators to keep the offer open to subscribers for at least 30 days before the date the operator <br>begins encrypting the first basic tier channel on the channel lineup and for at least 120 days after that date.  <br>NCTA suggested that the offer extend for only 30 days after the date that encryption begins.  We believe <br>that 30 days after the date of encryption would not afford affected consumers sufficient time to learn <br>about the effect of encryption and the consumer-protection measures available to them and act on the <br>information.  Furthermore, because encryption will affect only a very small number of subscribers, the <br>consumer protection measures we adopt will not be unduly onerous on cable operators.83 We expect these <br>transitional protections will substantially mitigate the costs to affected subscribers while they consider <br>alternative means for accessing the basic service tier.84  <br>

82 As we explain in paragraph 26, we believe that Medicaid is a reasonable way to establish need.  Medicaid users <br>receive readily identifiable identification cards that should make it easy for cable operators to identify whether a <br>subscriber is eligible for this protection.

because some consumers may own third-party provided IP-enabled devices that do not have the ability to <br>decrypt cable signals.85 Therefore, these commenters call for the Commission to reject the proposed rule, <br>or adopt special measures to mitigate disruption to consumers that use those third-party devices.86  <br>Specifically, these parties complain that existing cable set-top boxes and DTAs are not compatible with <br>IP-enabled devices because they do not output signals in a manner that third-party-provided IP-enabled <br>devices can access.87 Accordingly, such devices would not be compatible with the operator’s free <br>equipment offering – <i>i.e., </i>there would be no connection by which such devices could access the basic tier <br>channels–thus rendering such devices useless if a cable operator chooses to encrypt the basic tier. 88  <br>Commenters assert that such devices were purchased or manufactured on the expectation that <br>unencrypted basic service tier QAM signals would continue to be available from cable operators.  The <br>record indicates that at least four companies have developed products that rely on customers’ ability to <br>access clear-QAM signals, and that a relatively small number of consumers have purchased these devices <br>for this capability.89 As explained above, however, we anticipate the impact of encryption of the basic <br>tier on the public at large will be minimal because the record indicates that only a small number of <br>consumers rely on clear-QAM devices to access the basic tier.90 And, the record further indicates that <br>

subscribers who use IP-enabled clear-QAM devices that would be incompatible with the free equipment <br>offerings by cable operators represent an even smaller subset of clear-QAM users.91  <br>
20. To mitigate any harm to the small group of consumers that may use such devices, NCTA’s <br>
six largest incumbent cable members–serving 86 percent of all cable subscribers–have committed to <br>adopt, prior to encrypting, a solution that would provide basic service tier access to third-party provided <br>IP-enabled clear QAM devices.92 Pursuant to this commitment, these six cable operators will make basic <br>service tier channels available either via connection from operator-supplied equipment or by providing <br>access to the operator’s security technology.  Specifically, these cable operators have proposed to either <br>(i) provide a converter box with “standard home networking capability” that can provide IP-enabled clear <br>QAM devices access to basic service tier channels on the same terms proposed in the <i>Encryption NPRM <br></i>(“Option 1”),93 or (ii) enable IP-enabled clear QAM devices to access basic service tier channels without <br>any additional hardware through the use of commercially available software upgrades (“Option 2”).94  <br>NCTA proposed to sunset these commitments three years after we adopt this Order unless the <br>Commission extends them.95 Boxee and CEA argue that these commitments do not sufficiently support <br>the operation of IP-enabled clear QAM devices.  Instead, they advocate that all cable operators should be <br>required to make the basic service tier available to IP-enabled devices without additional hardware.96  <br>

93 NCTA’s commitment states:  “Cable Operators shall be permitted to encrypt their Basic Service Tiers in <br>Encrypted Systems at such time as they offer to basic tier subscribers with retail IP-enabled Clear QAM devices in <br>such systems an Operator-supplied set-top box, digital transport adapter (‘DTA’) or other Operator-supplied <br>equipment with standard home networking capability (e.g., equipment with a DLNA-enabled Ethernet connector or <br>Wi-Fi capability).  Such Operator-supplied equipment will be offered pursuant to the terms of the Transitional <br>Equipment Measures regarding notice to consumers and availability of equipment at no charge for a limited period <br>of time.  In Encrypted Systems that utilize DTA security, Cable Operators will support the delivery of the Basic <br>Service Tier to an IP-enabled Clear QAM Device with embedded DTA security (‘Retail DTA’) without the need for <br>Operator-supplied equipment.  Such Cable Operators will have no duty to offer Operator-supplied equipment to a <br>customer with a Retail DTA in such Encrypted Systems.”  NCTA Commitment Letter at 2.  <br>

CEA further encourages the Commission not to sunset the commitments after three years.97 The AllVid <br>Alliance suggests that the Commission initiate a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking comment on “a <br>nationally-portable common IP-based interface from MVPD services to consumer devices.”98<br>
21. We believe that the commitments from the six largest incumbent cable operators will be<br>
sufficient to address the compatibility issue concerning IP-enabled devices and achieve the objectives of <br>Section 624A of the Act – <i>i.e., </i>to ensure compatibility between cable service and consumer electronics <br>equipment.99 We do not extend the additional equipment requirement to smaller cable operators because <br>we do not believe it is necessary at this time.100 As noted above, based on the current record, only a small <br>number of consumers rely on IP-enabled devices to access the basic tier and thus we expect this particular <br>compatibility problem to be extremely limited in scope.101 Because the six largest incumbent cable <br>operators subject to the rule serve 86 percent of all cable subscribers nationwide, we expect most <br>consumers that use such devices will have ready access to the necessary equipment.102 Moreover, large <br>cable operators generally dictate equipment features to manufacturers and commonly get priority in <br>delivery of that equipment.103 We anticipate that the large operators’ demand for this equipment <br>eventually will lead all equipment to include this functionality in the marketplace, and thus the equipment <br>small cable operators provide will eventually include the IP functionality as well, regardless whether they <br>specify this particular feature.104 Nonetheless, we may revisit this issue if the equipment market does not <br>develop as expected or if we find that small cable operators do not make their service compatible with <br>these consumer devices.        <br>
22. Contrary to Boxee’s argument, nothing in Section 624A requires that consumer equipment <br>
compatibility be achieved by means of a hardware-free solution.105 Under the equipment measure we <br>adopt today, the vast majority of consumers will be able to access service that is encrypted using a <br>commercially available security technology or via equipment with standard home-networking capability <br>in much the same way they do today.  In fact, if this standard home-networking capability is connected to <br>a wireless home network, the consumer experience could improve because consumers will be able to <br>

access basic service tier channels without physically connecting a device to a coaxial plug from the <br>wall.106 Thus, mandating a hardware-free solution is not necessary to protect consumers in the context of <br>the instant proceeding.107<br>
23. We adopt these commitments as required preconditions to encrypting by the top six <br>
incumbent cable operators with slight modifications and clarifications.  These conditions will <br>automatically sunset three years from the release date of this Order unless the Media Bureau (“Bureau”) <br>determines prior to this date that the IP-enabled device protections remain necessary to protect <br>consumers.108 We believe that a future review of these rules is warranted because the market for these IP-<br>based devices is nascent and it is unclear whether consumer demand for this equipment will flourish.109  <br>Accordingly, we delegate authority to the Bureau to initiate a review two years after the release of this <br>Order to decide whether these IP-enabled device protections remain necessary to protect consumers or <br>whether it is appropriate to sunset the IP-enabled device protections.110  If the Bureau does not release an <br>order extending these protections within three years from the release date of this Order, then the consumer <br>protection measures concerning IP-enabled devices detailed in paragraph 20 will no longer apply to the <br>top-six cable operators for purposes of encryption of the basic service tier.  In deciding whether the sunset <br>is appropriate, the Bureau shall consider the costs to cable operators and the benefits to consumers, <br>whether competitive services are available, regulatory parity between cable and other MVPDs, the state of <br>technology and the marketplace, and cable operators’ efforts to meet these commitments and ensure <br>compatibility.111  The Bureau shall also consider whether the IP-enabled device protections should be <br>extended to small cable operators.    <br>
24. Second, we add some clarifying language to address Boxee and CEA’s concerns that cable <br>
operators could use licenses to limit retail device manufacturers from building compatible devices.112  <br>Any license terms that cable operators require for the “standard home networking capability”113 used to <br>offer access to the basic service tier in Option 1 and the “requirements necessary (including any <br>

The Bureau will consider the effect that these rules have on the market <br>for IP-enabled devices when it decides whether to sunset the consumer protection measures concerning IP-enabled <br>devices.<br>
109 Unlike the transitional equipment requirements applicable to all cable operators that address situations where the <br>customer has not been using equipment to access the basic service tier signals, the requirements applicable to the top <br>six incumbent cable providers are intended to address situations where the customer has been accessing the basic tier <br>signals using a third-party provided box that will be rendered useless absent the conditions we adopt today.<br>

authentication processes)” in Option 2 must be made available on a good faith basis.114 In adopting this <br>“good faith” licensing requirement, we intentionally do not specify any particular technology or <br>technology licensing model (<i>e.g</i>., we do not require or specify “fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory”<br>licensing, as that term has been interpreted in other contexts, as urged by Boxee and CEA).115  Third, we <br>require the operators that choose to offer access to the basic service tier using Option 1 to “publicly <br>disclose the DLNA profile or other protocol that is being used for the home-networking capability on <br>such operator-supplied equipment.” Such a requirement is necessary to ensure that third-party <br>manufacturers have the information necessary to build a device that works with cable-provided <br>equipment.116 We also remind cable operators that Section 76.640(b)(4)(iii) of our rules, which goes into <br>effect in December of this year, requires all high definition set-top boxes (except for one-way, non-<br>recording set-top boxes) to include an IP-compatible output based on an open industry standard that <br>provides for audiovisual communications including service discovery, video transport, and remote control <br>command pass-through standards for home networking.117  We believe that these additional consumer <br>protection measures will ease the transition to encrypted service for the vast majority of the small subset <br>of customers that rely on third-party provided IP-enabled devices to access the basic service tier.<br>
25. <i>Other Issues</i>.  Public Knowledge and Media Access Project state in their comments that there <br>
have been no complaints from customers in Cablevision’s encrypted systems about “hidden fees” related <br>to the free device offers, and they anticipate that cable operators “intend to act in good faith.”118  Out of <br>an abundance of caution, however, they suggest we affirmatively state that cable operators may not <br>impose service fees (such as “digital access fees” or “outlet fees”) in lieu of rental fees for the free <br>devices.119 Consistent with Public Knowledge and Media Access Project’s suggestion, we clarify that <br>
 <br>
 <br>
114 For example, it would be bad faith for a cable operator to charge an excessive amount for a third-party to license <br>the technology necessary to access these signals.  <i>See </i>CEA July 31 Ex Parte at 2.  This good faith requirement <br>applies only to the terms that cable operators impose.  This limit does not apply to licensing terms that are not <br>subject to cable operator control—for example, patent licenses for specific codecs.  Because CableLabs’ board of <br>directors consists largely of cable executives, this limit does apply to CableLabs’ licensing terms.  <i>See </i>About <br>CableLabs:  Board of Directors, <a title="http://www.cablelabs.com/about/board/" href="http://www.cablelabs.com/about/board/">http://www.cablelabs.com/about/board/</a> (last visited Aug. 10, 2012).  We note that <br>the NCTA letter already reflects a commitment by any of the six largest cable operators who elect to use Option 2 to <br>enable access to the basic service tier using “security technology that is licensable on a non-discriminatory basis.”  <br>NCTA Commitment Letter at 2.<br>

boxes provided by cable operators that choose to encrypt the basic service tier must be provided without <br>any additional service charges related to the equipment. <br>
26. Public Knowledge and Media Access Project also suggest that we tie the low-income <br>
condition to Lifeline/Linkup eligibility because Medicaid eligibility can vary from state to state.120 We <br>reject that suggestion as unnecessary.  As several commenters point out, Medicaid eligibility presents an <br>easily verifiable, bright-line test, and is less likely to cause confusion among subscribers and cable <br>customer service representatives.121<br>
27. We also reject calls from some commenters to require free equipment in perpetuity for <br>
existing subscribers, and not to limit free boxes to existing subscribers.122 The consumer protection <br>measures we adopt are intended to mitigate the disruption that may be experienced by current cable <br>subscribers.  We do not agree that free equipment is necessary for new subscribers:  given the movement <br>to digital services, many subscribers have become accustomed to leasing set-top devices, and that trend <br>seems likely to continue.123 Furthermore, we agree with NCTA that unnecessarily burdensome conditions <br>such as free devices for all new subscribers could discourage cable operators from encrypting and prevent <br>the public from realizing the benefits that stem from cable operators’ ability to remotely activate and <br>deactivate service which benefits most subscribers.124 Accordingly, we do not condition this rule change <br>on cable operators’ supplying free devices in perpetuity to existing subscribers or to new subscribers.125  <br>
28. Certain commenters express concern about the impact that basic service tier encryption could <br>
have on institutional subscribers and schools in particular.126 They suggest that the Commission extend <br>the free-device consumer protections to institutional subscribers to prevent the rule change from placing a <br>financial burden on them.127  Cable operators, however, suggest that these commenters conflate <br>encryption with digitization, and we agree.128 As cable operators transition to all-digital service, these <br>

institutional subscribers will need devices to convert digital signals to analog regardless of whether the <br>service is encrypted unless the institutional subscribers use television sets with clear-QAM tuners and <br>only use those televisions to access the basic service tier.129 Furthermore, Comcast argues that cable <br>operators establish agreements with local institutions on a case-by-case basis, and that each franchising <br>authority negotiates consumer protection measures to meet its needs.130 We are persuaded that it is <br>unnecessary to adopt consumer-protection measures with respect to institutional subscribers, because we <br>expect that cable operators will continue to work with local institutions – and may be required to do so by <br>franchising authorities – to ensure that the institutions’ needs will be met.  We emphasize that our rules <br>are not intended to limit or preempt existing, renegotiated, or future franchise agreements that provide <br>institutional subscribers more equipment on different terms than our rules require for residential <br>subscribers. We expect that cable operators will work closely with local franchising authorities and <br>institutions to ensure that any disruption institutional subscribers experience as a result of encryption will <br>be minimized.<br>
29. ACA and BendBroadband express concern about the effect that the conditions will have on <br>
small cable operators.131 We agree with ACA and BendBroadband that in some instances the benefits of <br>encryption may be outweighed by the burdens of administrative upgrades to account for the new billing <br>procedures needed to offer free devices for a limited period of time.  We note, however, that the decision <br>to encrypt the basic service tier will be a voluntary decision made at the sole discretion of the cable <br>operator under the rules we adopt here.  Thus, each cable operator may use its business judgment to <br>decide whether, and when, the benefits of encryption outweigh the costs of upgrading billing software and <br>providing equipment to its subscribers to ease the transition to encrypted service.132<br>
30. <i>Notification-Requirements</i>.  Based on the record, we believe that notification requirements <br>
are also necessary to protect consumers.  Therefore, we will require cable operators to notify their <br>subscribers about the planned encryption and the device offers at least 30 days before the date encryption <br>of the basic tier commences.  We will also require cable operators to notify their subscribers at least 30 <br>days, but no more than 60 days, before the end of the free device transitional period.  These notifications <br>are necessary to make the device-based consumer protection measures meaningful to consumers; the <br>measures would be meaningless if affected consumers were not made aware of the offers.<br>
31. NCTA proposed that our rules require cable operators to notify their subscribers about <br>
encryption and free device offers at least 30 days prior to the date encryption of the basic service tier <br>commences.133 Several commenters supported NCTA’s proposal,134 and we agree that it is important to <br>identify when cable operators must notify their subscribers about encryption.  Therefore, we will require <br>cable operators to notify their subscribers that they will encrypt at least 30 days before the date encryption <br>

of the basic service tier commences, at which time they must also include information about the <br>transitional device requirements set forth in Section 76.630.135 The notice must state:<br>
On (DATE), (NAME OF CABLE OPERATOR) will start encrypting (INSERT <br>NAME OF CABLE BASIC SERVICE TIER OFFERING) on your cable system. <br>If you have a set-top box, digital transport adapter (DTA), or a retail CableCARD <br>device connected to each of your TVs, you will be unaffected by this change. <br>However, if you are currently receiving (INSERT NAME OF CABLE BASIC <br>SERVICE TIER OFFERING) on any TV without equipment supplied by <br>(NAME OF CABLE OPERATOR), you will lose the ability to view any <br>channels on that TV.<br>
If you are affected, you should contact (NAME OF CABLE OPERATOR) to <br>arrange for the equipment you need to continue receiving your services. In such <br>case, you are entitled to receive equipment at no additional charge or service fee <br>for a limited period of time. The number and type of devices you are entitled to <br>receive and for how long will vary depending on your situation. If you are a <br>(INSERT NAME OF CABLE BASIC SERVICE TIER OFFERING) customer <br>and receive the service on your TV without (NAME OF CABLE OPERATOR)-<br>supplied equipment, you are entitled to up to two devices for two years (five <br>years if you also receive Medicaid). If you subscribe to a higher level of service <br>and receive (INSERT NAME OF CABLE BASIC SERVICE TIER OFFERING) <br>on a secondary TV without (NAME OF CABLE OPERATOR)-supplied <br>equipment, you are entitled to one device for one year.<br>
You can learn more about this equipment offer and eligibility at (WEBPAGE <br>
ADDRESS) or by calling (PHONE NUMBER). To qualify for any equipment at <br>no additional charge or service fee, you must request the equipment between<br>(DATE THAT IS 30 DAYS BEFORE ENCRYPTION) and (DATE THAT IS <br>120 DAYS AFTER ENCRYPTION) and satisfy all other eligibility <br>requirements.<br>
We believe that 30 days’ notice will provide a reasonable opportunity for affected consumers to avail <br>themselves of free device offers in advance of basic service tier encryption without unduly burdening <br>cable operators.  In addition, at least 30 days, but no more than 60 days, before the end of the free device <br>transitional period, a cable operator that encrypts must notify subscribers that have taken advantage of the <br>transitional period that the period is ending as follows:<br>
You currently receive equipment necessary to descramble or decrypt the basic <br>service tier signals (either a set-top box or CableCARD) free of charge.  Effective <br>with the (MONTH/YEAR) billing cycle, (NAME OF CABLE OPERATOR) will <br>begin charging you for the equipment you received to access (INSERT NAME <br>OF CABLE BASIC SERVICE TIER OFFERING) when (NAME OF CABLE <br>OPERATOR) started encrypting those channels on your cable system.  The <br>monthly charge for the (TYPE OF DEVICE) will be (AMOUNT OF CHARGE).<br>

While our rule prescribes the language that cable operators must use to notify their subscribers about <br>encryption and the device-based protection measures, we leave open the option for cable operators to <br>supplement this notice as they see fit.  We will not require the six largest incumbent cable operators to <br>provide special notice to their subscribers about the availability of IP-enabled device compatibility, <br>though they must comply with existing notice requirements.136 Third-party IP-enabled device <br>manufacturers have an economic incentive to ensure their customers are aware of the functions and <br>features of their devices, <i>e.g., </i>provide notice to their customers in marketing materials about the need to <br>obtain IP-enabled equipment from their cable operator and the special equipment the six largest <br>incumbent cable operators are required to offer their subscribers under Commission rules.137<br>
32.  Public Knowledge and Media Access Project proposed that we require operators to notify <br>
subscribers when their free device period is ending on each monthly bill for the three months preceding <br>the end of the transition period.138 We agree that preventing “bill shock” is important, and Section <br>76.1603(d) of our rules requires cable operators to provide written notice of any increase in price to be <br>charged for equipment necessary to access the basic service tier at least 30 days before the increase is <br>effective.139 We do not believe that the three notices that Public Knowledge and Media Access Project <br>propose are necessary.  But we are concerned that cable operators could notify their subscribers too early <br>in the transition period to render notification essentially meaningless.140 Therefore, we believe it is <br>important to define the window for notices more precisely so that affected subscribers are notified no <br>more than 60 days before the end of the transitional free-device period.  At that time, affected subscribers <br>can determine the course that best suits their circumstances.  Some subscribers may opt to continue their <br>current level of service and pay for the additional equipment charges.  Other subscribers may choose to <br>reduce their level of service or terminate their existing cable service and pursue a competitive alternative <br>that better meets their service needs and budgets.141  <br>
33. The New York City Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications (NYC<br>
DoITT) argues that, because Cablevision’s encryption of its New York City systems is nascent, the <br>Commission cannot be sure of the long-term effects that basic service tier encryption may have.142  <br>
 <br>
 <br>
136 We believe that our existing rules provide cable subscribers with adequate notice:  Section 76.1621(c) of the <br>Commission’s rules requires operators to determine the specific equipment needed by individual subscribers on a <br>case-by-case basis, and to make good faith efforts to provide subscribers with the types of special equipment needed <br>to resolve their individual compatibility problems.  47 C.F.R. § 76.1621(c).  In addition, Section 76.1622  requires <br>operators to educate subscribers annually about compatibility issues.  47 C.F.R. § 76.1622.<br>

Therefore, NYC DoITT encourages the Commission to make this rule change temporary.143 We agree <br>that we cannot predict how our rule change will affect the cable industry and subscribers with absolute <br>certainty.  The information before us indicates, however, that this rule change will result in the substantial <br>public interest benefits discussed above and that any additional burdens imposed on a limited number of <br>subscribers will be tempered by the consumer protection measures adopted herein.  The Commission will <br>keep apprised of the consequences of the rule change and, if the situation develops differently than <br>predicted, we can revisit the issue on our own initiative or in response to a petition for rulemaking.144 In <br>the future, we may seek information from the operators that have chosen to encrypt to ensure that the <br>expected benefits are being achieved and any burdens to consumers are being minimized.  However, <br>nothing in the record persuades us that it is necessary to build a sunset into the rule.<br>
<p><b>D.</b></p>
<p><b>Legal Basis </b></p>
34. Section 624A of the Communications Act provides the Commission broad authority to make <br>
changes to our encryption rule and to impose the consumer-protection measures we adopt today.145  <br>Congress’s objective in enacting Section 624A was to ensure compatibility between cable systems and <br>consumer TV (receiving and recording) equipment, consistent with the need to prevent theft of cable <br>service.146 Section 624A(b)(2) directs the Commission to “determine whether and, if so, under what <br>circumstances to permit cable systems to scramble or encrypt signals or to restrict cable systems in the <br>manner in which they encrypt or scramble signals.”147 Section 624A(d) directs the Commission to <br>periodically review and modify regulations adopted pursuant to Section 624A “to reflect improvements <br>and changes in cable systems, television receivers, video cassette recorders and similar technology.”148  <br>The record suggests that to achieve the statutory goals of Section 624A a blanket ban on encryption is no <br>longer necessary, and that changes in cable technology justify relaxing the rule for all-digital cable <br>systems, provided consumer protection measures are addressed.  As explained above, cable technology is <br>markedly different than it was when the Commission first adopted the encryption prohibition set forth in <br>Section 76.630.149 For example, the transition to all-digital systems means that encryption of the basic <br>service tier will permit remote activation and deactivation of cable service resulting in significant savings <br>of time and resources for both cable operators and the vast majority of cable customers.150 Furthermore, <br>as discussed below, the CableCARD standard provides an avenue for consumers to purchase consumer <br>electronics devices that are compatible with digital cable service, which achieves Congress’ stated goal in <br>Section 624A.151  <br>

35. Relaxing the encryption rule in this manner will not impede Section 624A’s goal of <br>
compatibility between consumer electronics equipment and cable systems. The Commission has adopted <br>a standard that allows for “plug and play”152 compatibility between consumer electronics devices and <br>cable systems.153 This standard provides a clear path for device manufacturers to follow if they wish to <br>build devices that are compatible with digital cable systems and can access all linear digital cable <br>services.154 Montgomery County, Maryland argues that the CableCARD standard is not successful, and <br>that the Commission should endeavor to relieve compatibility problems, rather than compound them.155  <br>According to Montgomery County, relaxing the encryption rule will lead to compatibility problems <br>because consumers will no longer be able to use clear-QAM tuners on non-primary television sets.156  <br>However, the Commission has already adopted a solution for compatibility between consumer electronics <br>equipment and digital cable:  the CableCARD standard is intended to allow consumers to buy compatible <br>retail devices to access all linear digital cable services as opposed to the basic-only service that clear-<br>QAM tuners can access without additional equipment.  Indeed, the Commission’s cable-ready labeling <br>rules prohibit device manufacturers from labeling their devices as “digital cable ready” unless they <br>comply with the CableCARD standards.  Thus, under our existing rules, manufacturers should not have <br>indicated to consumers that devices could receive digital cable service unless those devices were, in fact, <br>CableCARD-compatible.157 Therefore, we disagree with Montgomery County’s characterization that <br>encryption will lead to an abundance of compatibility problems due to the rule changes adopted herein.  <br>Section 624A(c)(1)(B) expressly directs the Commission to consider “the costs and benefits to consumers <br>of imposing compatibility requirements on cable operators.”158 As discussed above, the costs associated <br>with a blanket encryption prohibition in all-digital systems greatly outweigh the anticipated benefits to <br>consumers,159 particularly in light of the consumer protection measures we are also adopting.160  <br>

Furthermore, in 2010, the Commission adopted changes to the CableCARD rules, including streamlined <br>device approval procedures, a self-installation option, and a prohibition on price discrimination against <br>CableCARD devices, that should increase the retail availability and the quality of experience for <br>CableCARD devices and further increase compatibility between consumer electronics and cable service <br>by ensuring that retail devices can access all linear digital cable services.161 Given these technological <br>and rule changes, we conclude that a complete prohibition on basic service tier encryption in all-digital <br>systems is no longer necessary to ensure compatibility between consumer electronics devices and cable <br>service, provided certain consumer protection measures are satisfied.162<br>
36. We also conclude that the requirement in Section 623(b)(3)(A) of the Act to base any price <br>
or rate standards for equipment installation and leasing on actual cost does not bar the Commission from <br>imposing the consumer protection measures set forth in Sections 76.630(a)(1)(ii)-(vi) of our new rules.163  <br>The commenters who addressed our legal authority agree that the consumer protection measures–which <br>are adopted as a transitional measure and implicate a limited number of affected customers—do not run <br>afoul of Section 623 of the Communications Act,164 and we did not receive any comments claiming that <br>the consumer protection measures, as structured, would violate 623.  These measures are not being <br>imposed as a regulation of equipment rates under Section 623.  Rather, the consumer protection measures <br>are being adopted pursuant to Section 624A(b)(2)’s broad grant of authority to the Commission to <br>determine “under what circumstances to permit cable systems to scramble or encrypt signals or to restrict <br>cable systems in the manner in which they encrypt or scramble signals.”165 We have determined that <br>relaxing the encryption prohibition should be permitted for all-digital systems, provided the potential <br>harm to affected consumers is minimized.  Our new rule permits a cable operator to elect to abide by the <br>encryption prohibition without having any obligation to offer subscribers equipment for a transitional <br>period.  It is only when a cable operator chooses to encrypt the basic service tier that it is required to <br>comply with the requisite regulatory conditions (by providing set-top boxes at no cost to affected <br>subscribers for a limited transitional period). Thus, this requirement is imposed as a condition of a cable <br>operator’s voluntary election to encrypt the basic service tier, and not as a rate regulation imposed under <br>Section 623(b)(3)(A).   <br>
<p><b>E.</b></p>
<p><b>Waiver Requests</b></p>
37. As mentioned in paragraph 5 above, the Commission has pending before it four petitions for <br>
waiver of the encryption ban.166 These petitions have been pending for more than a year.  Petitioners seek <br>

162 CEA and the AllVid Tech Company Alliance filed comments suggesting that the Commission should only act on <br>basic service tier encryption in the broader context of device compatibility and the AllVid proceeding and that the <br>Commission must take steps to comply with Section 629 of the Act.  AllVid Tech Company Alliance Comments at <br>2-3; CEA Comments at 10-12.  We agree with CEA and the AllVid Tech Company Alliance that ensuring the <br>effective implementation of Section 629 of the Act and continuing future device compatibility are important issues <br>that the Commission must resolve.  However, we agree with Cablevision that those important issues need not be <br>resolved before revising the ban on encryption of the basic service tier.  Cablevision Reply at 5.<br>

<p><b>IV.</b></p>
<p><b>CONCLUSION</b></p>
38. We conclude that allowing cable operators to encrypt the basic service tier in all-digital <br>
systems will result in substantial, tangible benefits to both consumers and cable operators with minimal <br>countervailing burdens on affected subscribers.  We believe that the consumer-protection measures that <br>we adopt will mitigate any burdens that encryption will have on the limited number of consumers that <br>may be affected by the instant rule change.<br>

Part 76 of Title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations will be amended as follows:<br>
I.  SUBPART K – TECHNICAL STANDARDS<br>
1. Amend § 76.630 to revise paragraph (a), delete Notes 1 and 4, and redesignate notes 2 and 3 as <br>
notes 1 and 2 to read as follows: <br>
§ 76.630  Compatibility with consumer electronics equipment.<br>
(a)  Cable system operators shall not scramble or otherwise encrypt signals <b>delivered to a subscriber<br></b>on the basic service tier. <br>
<b>(1)  This prohibition shall not apply in systems in which:</b><br>
<b>(i) no encrypted signals are carried using the NTSC system; and</b><br>
<b>(ii) the cable system operator offers to its existing subscribers who <br>subscribe only to the basic service tier without use of a set-top box or <br>CableCARD at the time of encryption the equipment necessary to <br>descramble or decrypt the basic service tier signals (the subscriber’s <br>choice of a set-top box or CableCARD) on up to two television sets <br>without charge or service fee for two years from the date encryption of <br>the basic service tier commences; and</b><br>
<b>(iii) the cable system operator offers to its existing subscribers who <br>subscribe to a level of service above “basic only” but use a digital <br>television or other device with a clear-QAM tuner to receive only the <br>basic service tier without use of a set-top box or CableCARD at the <br>time of encryption, the equipment necessary to descramble or decrypt <br>the basic service tier signals (the subscriber’s choice of a set-top box or <br>CableCARD) on one television set without charge or service fee for one <br>year from the date encryption of the basic service tier commences; and </b><br>
<b>(iv) the cable system operator offers to its existing subscribers who <br>receive Medicaid and also subscribe only to the basic service tier <br>without use of a set-top box or CableCARD at the time of encryption <br>the equipment necessary to descramble or decrypt the basic service tier <br>signals (the subscriber’s choice of a set-top box or CableCARD) on up <br>to two television sets without charge or service fee for five years from <br>the date encryption of the basic service tier commences; </b><br>
<b>(vi) the cable system operator notifies its existing subscribers of the </b><br>

<p><b>APPENDIX B</b></p>
<p><b>Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis</b></p>
1. As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, as amended (RFA),1 an Initial <br>
Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA) was incorporated in the <i>Notice of Proposed Rule Making<br></i>(<i>NPRM</i>).2 The Commission sought written public comment on the proposals in the <i>NPRM</i>, including <br>comment on the IRFA.3 No commenting parties specifically addressed the IRFA.  This present Final <br>Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (FRFA) conforms to the RFA.  The Commission will send a copy of the <br>R&amp;O, including this FRFA, to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration.4 In <br>addition, the R&amp;O and FRFA (or summaries thereof) will be published in the Federal Register.5  <br>
<p><b>A.</b></p>
<p><b>Need for, and Objectives of the Proposed Rules. </b></p>
2. With this Report and Order, the Commission amends its rules to allow cable operators to <br>
encrypt the basic service tier in all-digital cable systems if they comply with certain consumer-protection <br>measures.  This rule change will benefit consumers who can have their cable service activated and <br>deactivated from a remote location. By allowing remote activation and deactivation, we expect our <br>amended rules will result in benefits to both cable operators and consumers by significantly reducing the <br>number of service calls associated with provisioning service and significantly reducing the need for <br>subscribers to wait for service calls to activate or deactivate cable service.  At the same time, we <br>recognize that this rule change will adversely affect a small number of cable subscribers who currently <br>view the digital basic service tier without using a set-top box or other equipment.  If a cable operator <br>decides to encrypt the digital basic tier, then these subscribers will need equipment to continue viewing <br>the channels on this tier.  To give those consumers time to resolve the incompatibility between consumer <br>electronics equipment (such as digital television sets) and newly encrypted cable service, we require <br>operators of cable systems that choose to encrypt the basic service tier to comply with certain consumer <br>protection measures for a period of time.  The Commission concludes that allowing cable operators to <br>encrypt the basic service tier in all-digital systems will lead to benefits like decreased service calls and <br>theft of service, with few associated burdens on consumers.  Therefore the Commission believes that this <br>rule change will reduce burdens on small entities.  The Commission predicts that encryption of the basic <br>service tier will not substantially affect compatibility between cable service and consumer electronics <br>equipment for most subscribers because over 75 percent of subscribers already have set-top boxes to <br>decrypt the signals.  Because the rule is voluntary—a cable operator with an all-digital system may <br>choose whether to encrypt that system—each cable operator may decide whether the benefits of <br>encryption (which include reduced service calls and reduced theft) outweigh the cost of providing its <br>subscribers with the equipment they will need to continue viewing the channels on the basic service tier. .<br>
3. The need for FCC regulation in this area derives from changing technology in the cable <br>
services market.  When the Commission adopted technical rules in the 1990s, digital cable service was in <br>its infancy, and therefore the rules were adopted with analog cable service in mind.  Today, digital cable <br>

service is common, and the encryption rule does not translate well in systems that offer all-digital service.  <br>Therefore, the Commission will allow all-digital cable operators to encrypt the basic service tier.<br>
4. We recognize that some consumers subscribe only to a cable operator’s digital basic service <br>
tier and currently are able to do so without using a set-top box or other equipment. Similarly, there are <br>consumers that may have a set-top box on a primary television but access the unencrypted digital basic <br>service tier on second or third televisions in their home without using a set-top box or other equipment.  <br>Although we expect the number of subscribers in these situations to be extremely small, these consumers <br>may be affected by lifting the encryption prohibition for all-digital cable systems.  To address this <br>problem, we conclude that operators of all-digital cable systems that choose to encrypt the basic service <br>tier must comply with certain consumer protection measures for a limited period of time in order to <br>minimize any potential subscriber disruption,6 including a requirement that the six largest cable operators <br>offer IP-enabled set-top boxes to subscribers as part of these protections.<br>
5. The Commission believes that the rule will save small entities money.  The consumer <br>
protection element of the rule—the requirement that cable operators offer existing basic tier customers <br>set-top boxes without charge for certain lengths of time—does associate a cost with the rule. But the <br>Commission believes that the financial benefit to small cable operators in reduced truck rolls and theft of <br>services will far outweigh that cost.  Furthermore, because the decision of whether to encrypt the basic <br>tier is voluntary, small businesses will be able to make a business decision about whether to encrypt.<br>

6. The authority for the action proposed in this rulemaking is contained in Sections 1, 4(i) and <br>
(j), 303(r),  601,  and 624A of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. §§ 151, 154(i) <br>and (j), 303(r), 521, and 544a.  <br>

<p><b>Description and Estimate of the Number of Small Entities to Which the Proposed </b></p>
<p><b>Rules Will Apply</b></p>.<br>
7. The RFA directs the Commission to provide a description of and, where feasible, an estimate <br>
of the number of small entities that will be affected by the proposed rules.7  The RFA generally defines the <br>term “small entity” as having the same meaning as the terms “small business,” “small organization,” and <br>“small governmental entity” under Section 3 of the Small Business Act.8  In addition, the term “small <br>business” has the same meaning as the term “small business concern” under the Small Business Act.9 A <br>
 <br>
 <br>
6 A cable operator that chooses to encrypt must (i) offer to existing subscribers who subscribe only to the basic <br>service tier and do not use a set-top box or CableCARD, the subscriber’s choice of a set-top box or CableCARD on <br>up to two television sets without charge for two years from the date of encryption; (ii) offer existing subscribers who <br>subscribe to a level of service above “basic only” but use an additional television set to access only the basic service <br>tier without the use of a set-top box or CableCARD at the time of encryption, the subscriber’s choice of a set-top <br>box or CableCARD on one television set without charge for one year from the date of encryption; and (iii) offer <br>existing subscribers who receive Medicaid, subscribe only to the basic service tier, and do not use a set-top box or <br>CableCARD, the subscriber’s choice of a set-top box or CableCARD on up to two television sets without charge for <br>five years from the date of encryption.<br>
7 5 U.S.C. § 603(b)(3). <br>8 5 U.S.C. § 601(3) (incorporating by reference the definition of “small business concern” in 15 U.S.C. § 632).  <br>Pursuant to the RFA, the statutory definition of a small business applies, “unless an agency, after consultation with <br>the Office of Advocacy of the SBA and after opportunity for public comment, establishes one or more definitions of <br>such the term which are appropriate to the activities of the agency and publishes such definition(s) in the Federal <br>Register.  <br>
9 5 U.S.C. § 601(3) (incorporating by reference the definition of “small business concern” in the Small Business Act, <br>15 U.S.C. § 632).  Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 601(3), the statutory definition of a small business applies “unless an <br>

small business concern is one which:  (1) is independently owned and operated; (2) is not dominant in its <br>field of operation; and (3) satisfies any additional criteria established by the Small Business <br>Administration (“SBA”).10<br>
8. Cable and Other Program Distribution. Since 2007, these services have been defined within <br>
the broad economic census category of Wired Telecommunications Carriers; that category is defined as <br>follows: “This industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in operating and/or providing access <br>to transmission facilities and infrastructure that they own and/or lease for the transmission of voice, data, <br>text, sound, and video using wired telecommunications networks. Transmission facilities may be based on <br>a single technology or a combination of technologies.”11 The SBA has developed a small business size <br>standard for this category, which is: all such firms having 1,500 or fewer employees.12 According to <br>Census Bureau data for 2007, there were a total of 955 firms in this previous category that operated for <br>the entire year.13 Of this total, 939 firms had employment of 999 or fewer employees, and 16 firms had <br>employment of 1000 employees or more.14 Thus, under this size standard, the majority of firms can be <br>considered small and may be affected by rules adopted pursuant to the NPRM.<br>
9. Cable Companies and Systems (Rate Regulation Standard).  The Commission has also <br>
developed its own small business size standards for the purpose of cable rate regulation.  Under the <br>Commission’s rules, a “small cable company” is one serving 400,000 or fewer subscribers nationwide.15  <br>As of 2008, out of 814 cable operators,16 all but 10 (that is, 804) qualify as small cable companies under <br>this standard.17 In addition, under the Commission’s rules, a “small system” is a cable system serving <br>15,000 or fewer subscribers.18 Current Commission records show 6,000 cable systems.  Of these, 726 <br>have 20,000 subscribers or more, based on the same records.  We estimate that there are 5,000 small <br>systems based upon this standard.<br>
10. Cable System Operators (Telecom Act Standard). <b> </b>The Communications Act of 1934, as <br>
amended, also contains a size standard for small cable system operators, which is “a cable operator that, <br>directly or through an affiliate, serves in the aggregate fewer than 1 percent of all subscribers in the <br>United States and is not affiliated with any entity or entities whose gross annual revenues in the aggregate <br>exceed $250,000,000.”19 There are approximately 63.7 million cable subscribers in the United States <br>(Continued from previous page)__________________<br>agency, after consultation with the Office of Advocacy of the Small Business Administration and after opportunity <br>for public comment, establishes one or more definitions of such term which are appropriate to the activities of the <br>agency and publishes such definition(s) in the Federal Register.”<br>
10 15 U.S.C. § 632.  Application of the statutory criteria of dominance in its field of operation, and independence are <br>sometime difficult to apply in the context of broadcast television.  Accordingly, the Commission’s statistical account <br>of television stations may be over-inclusive.<br>

today.20 Accordingly, an operator serving fewer than 637,000 subscribers shall be deemed a small <br>operator, if its annual revenues, when combined with the total annual revenues of all its affiliates, do not <br>exceed $250 million in the aggregate.21 Based on available data, we find that the number of cable <br>operators serving 637,000 subscribers or less is also 804.22 We note that the Commission neither requests <br>nor collects information on whether cable system operators are affiliated with entities whose gross annual <br>revenues exceed $250 million.23 Although it seems certain that some of these cable system operators are <br>affiliated with entities whose gross annual revenues exceed $250,000,000, we are unable at this time to <br>estimate with greater precision the number of cable system operators that would qualify as small cable <br>operators under the definition in the Communications Act.<br>
11. Direct Broadcast Satellite (“DBS”) Service<i>. </i>DBS service is a nationally distributed <br>
subscription service that delivers video and audio programming via satellite to a small parabolic “dish” <br>antenna at the subscriber’s location.  DBS, by exception, is now included in the SBA’s broad economic <br>census category, “Wired Telecommunications Carriers,”24 which was developed for small wireline firms.  <br>Under this category, the SBA deems a wireline business to be small if it has 1,500 or fewer employees.25  <br>However, the data we have available as a basis for estimating the number of such small entities were <br>gathered under a superseded SBA small business size standard formerly titled “Cable and Other Program <br>Distribution.”  The definition of Cable and Other Program Distribution provided that a small entity is one <br>with $12.5 million or less in annual receipts.26 Currently, only two entities provide DBS service, which <br>requires a great investment of capital for operation:  DIRECTV and EchoStar Communications <br>Corporation (“EchoStar”) (marketed as the DISH Network).27 Each currently offer subscription services.  <br>DIRECTV28 and EchoStar29 each report annual revenues that are in excess of the threshold for a small <br>

23 The Commission does receive such information on a case-by-case basis if a cable operator appeals a local <br>franchise authority’s finding that the operator does not qualify as a small cable operator pursuant to § 76.901(f) of <br>the Commission’s rules.  <i>See </i>47 C.F.R. § 76.901(f).<br>
24 <i>See </i>13 C.F.R. § 121.201, NAICS code 517110 (2007).  The 2007 North American Industry Classification System <br>(“NAICS”) defines the category of “Wired Telecommunications Carriers” as follows: “This industry comprises <br>establishments primarily engaged in operating and/or providing access to transmission facilities and infrastructure <br>that they own and/or lease for the transmission of voice, data, text, sound, and video using wired <br>telecommunications networks.  Transmission facilities may be based on a single technology or a combination of <br>technologies.  Establishments in this industry use the wired telecommunications network facilities that they operate <br>to provide a variety of services, such as wired telephony services, including VoIP services; wired (cable) audio and <br>video programming distribution; and wired broadband Internet services.  <i>By exception, establishments providing <br>satellite television distribution services using facilities and infrastructure that they operate are included in this <br>industry.</i>” (<i>Emphasis </i>added to text relevant to satellite services.)

business.  Because DBS service requires significant capital, we believe it is unlikely that a small entity as <br>defined by the SBA would have the financial wherewithal to become a DBS service provider.  We seek <br>comments that have data on the annual revenues and number of employees of DBS service providers.<br>
12. Satellite Master Antenna Television (SMATV) Systems, also known as Private Cable <br>
Operators (PCOs).  SMATV systems or PCOs are video distribution facilities that use closed transmission <br>paths without using any public right-of-way.  They acquire video programming and distribute it via <br>terrestrial wiring in urban and suburban multiple dwelling units such as apartments and condominiums, <br>and commercial multiple tenant units such as hotels and office buildings.  SMATV systems or PCOs are <br>now included in the SBA’s broad economic census category, “Wired Telecommunications Carriers,”30<br>which was developed for small wireline firms.31 Under this category, the SBA deems a wireline business <br>to be small if it has 1,500 or fewer employees.32 However, the data we have available as a basis for <br>estimating the number of such small entities were gathered under a superseded SBA small business size <br>standard formerly titled “Cable and Other Program Distribution.”  The definition of Cable and Other <br>Program Distribution provided that a small entity is one with $12.5 million or less in annual receipts.33  <br>As of June 2004, there were approximately 135 members in the Independent Multi-Family <br>Communications Council (IMCC), the trade association that represents PCOs.34 The IMCC indicates <br>that, as of June 2006, PCOs serve about 1 to 2 percent of the multichannel video programming <br>distributors (MVPD) marketplace.35 Individual PCOs often serve approximately 3,000-4,000 subscribers, <br>but the larger operations serve as many as 15,000-55,000 subscribers.  In total, as of June 2006, PCOs <br>serve approximately 900,000 subscribers.36 Because these operators are not rate regulated, they are not <br>required to file financial data with the Commission.  Furthermore, we are not aware of any privately <br>published financial information regarding these operators.  Based on the estimated number of operators <br>and the estimated number of units served by the largest 10 PCOs, we believe that a substantial number of <br>PCOs may have been categorized as small entities under the now superseded SBA small business size <br>standard for Cable and Other Program Distribution.37<br>
13. Open Video Services.  The open video system (“OVS”) framework was established in 1996, <br>
and is one of four statutorily recognized options for the provision of video programming services by local <br>exchange carriers.38 The OVS framework provides opportunities for the distribution of video <br>

programming other than through cable systems.  Because OVS operators provide subscription services,39<br>OVS falls within the SBA small business size standard covering cable services, which is “Wired <br>Telecommunications Carriers.”40 The SBA has developed a small business size standard for this <br>category, which is:  all such firms having 1,500 or fewer employees.  According to Census Bureau data <br>for 2007, there were a total of 3,188 firms in this previous category that operated for the entire year.41 Of <br>this total, 3,144 firms had employment of 999 or fewer employees, and 44 firms had employment of 1000 <br>employees or more.42 Thus, under this size standard, most cable systems are small and may be affected <br>by rules adopted pursuant to the NPRM.  In addition, we note that the Commission has certified some <br>OVS operators, with some now providing service.43 Broadband service providers (“BSPs”) are currently <br>the only significant holders of OVS certifications or local OVS franchises.44 The Commission does not <br>have financial or employment information regarding the entities authorized to provide OVS, some of <br>which may not yet be operational.  Thus, again, at least some of the OVS operators may qualify as small <br>entities.<br>
14. Computer Terminal Manufacturing.  “Computer terminals are input/output devices that <br>
connect with a central computer for processing.”45 The SBA has developed a small business size standard <br>for this category of manufacturing; that size standard is 1,000 or fewer employees.46 According to 2007 <br>Census Bureau data, there were 42 establishments in this category that operated during 2007. Only 3 had <br>more than 100 employees.47 Consequently, we estimate that all of these establishments are small entities.<br>
15. Other Computer Peripheral Equipment Manufacturing<i>. </i><b> </b>Examples of peripheral equipment in <br>
this category include keyboards, mouse devices, monitors, and scanners.48 The SBA has developed a <br>small business size standard for this category of manufacturing; that size standard is 1,000 or fewer <br>employees.49 According to 2007 Census Bureau data, there were 647 establishments in this category that <br>operated  in 2007.50 Of these, only 62 had more than 100 employees. Consequently, we estimate that the <br>majority of these establishments are small entities.<br>

manufacturer is small if it has less than 750 employees.51  Data contained in the 2007 U.S. Census <br>indicate that 491 establishments operated in that industry for all or part of that year. In that year, 376 <br>establishments had between 1 and 19 employees; 80 had between 20 and 99 employees; and 35 had more <br>than 100 employees.52 Thus, under the applicable size standard, a majority of manufacturers of audio and <br>video equipment may be considered small.<br>
<p><b>D.</b></p>
<p><b>Description of Reporting, Recordkeeping and Other Compliance Requirements</b></p>
17. The rules adopted in the Order will require cable operators to notify their subscribers about <br>
offers of free equipment associated with encryption.  The rule also requires a cable operator to notify its <br>subscribers when those subscribers are subject to charges at the end of the free equipment period.  <br>
<p><b>E.</b></p>
<p><b>Steps Taken to Minimize Significant Impact on Small Entities, and Significant <br>Alternatives Considered. </b></p><i> </i><br>
18. The RFA requires an agency to describe any significant alternatives that it has considered in <br>
reaching its proposed approach, which may include the following four alternatives (among others): (1) the <br>establishment of differing compliance or reporting requirements or timetables that take into account the <br>resources available to small entities; (2) the clarification, consolidation, or simplification of compliance or <br>reporting requirements under the rule for small entities; (3) the use of performance, rather than design, <br>standards; and (4) an exemption from coverage of the rule, or any part thereof, for small entities.53<br>
19. As an alternative to the rules the Commission adopted, the Commission considered leaving <br>
the current rule in place—with the result that no cable operator would realize the benefits of encryption—<br>or exempting small cable companies from the consumer protection rules that require encrypting cable <br>operators to provide certain subscribers with free set-top boxes for a limited time.  The Commission <br>rejected leaving the rule in place because that alternative would not lead to the benefits of reduced service <br>calls and reduced cable theft.  The Commission rejected exempting small cable companies from the <br>consumer protection rules because it concluded that the protections are necessary to give affected <br>consumers time to consider how to make consumer electronics equipment (such as digital television sets) <br>compatible with newly encrypted cable service.  For these reasons, the Commission concluded that basic <br>service tier encryption prohibition should be relaxed.

<i>Re:  Basic Service Tier Encryption, MB Docket No. 11-169</i><br>
Today is a good day for consumers and for innovation in the video market. The Commission <br>
removes regulatory barriers that prevented cable companies from remotely activating service and forced <br>consumers to wait for the cable guy to show up at their homes. At the same time, we ensure that <br>encrypting cable signals won’t limit consumers from using an ever-growing number of Internet-<br>connected, third-party video devices, and keep barriers low for video device innovators. We make clear <br>that cable companies can only encrypt their signals so long as these important pro-consumer, pro-<br>innovation protections remain in place—to decouple the two components of the Order would shortchange <br>consumers and innovators.<br>
I appreciate the constructive participation of a number of stakeholders in this process. And I want <br>
to thank the FCC staff whose outstanding and diligent work produced an Order that removes regulatory <br>barriers without harming innovation, all for the benefit of consumers.<br>

<p><b>STATEMENT OF</b></p>
<p><b>COMMISSIONER ROBERT M. McDOWELL</b></p>
<p><b>APPROVING IN PART, CONCURRING IN PART</b></p>
<i>Re:  Basic Service Tier Encryption, MB Docket No. 11-169</i><br>
At long last, we provide cable operators with the freedom to encrypt their basic service tier <br>
offering.  Encryption will allow cable operators to activate and deactivate cable service remotely to better <br>serve their customers.  This newly-allowed ability will also prevent theft of service while evening the <br>regulatory playing field with satellite providers that have not been subject to this rule. <br>
 <br>
On the other hand, there are some aspects of this order that, as a matter of good government, <br>
should have been handled differently.  First, the Commission could have decided this matter more <br>expeditiously.  Needless delay of the relief we provide today has frustrated the private sector’s ability to <br>meet consumer demand.  Going forward, it is my hope that the Commission will work with greater <br>alacrity when pursuing the noble goal of providing greater flexibility to the private sector.  <br>
Second, in light of the flexibility we grant today, the six largest cable providers have committed <br>
to ensure basic service tier access to third-party IP-enabled devices.  These commitments are <br>preconditions to encryption for these entities.  I am pleased that these IP-enabled device protections will <br>sunset in three years; however, the Commission today also delegates to the Media Bureau authority to <br>extend these protections should the bureau decide they are necessary to protect consumers.  I would prefer <br>that the Commission, rather than the bureau, make this call.  I am concerned that delegating this authority <br>to the bureau may invite further unnecessary delay.<br>
Additionally, an ordering clause states that, if any of the Order’s rule changes are invalidated, the <br>
remaining provisions will not be effective.  I have concerns regarding the possible inconvenience and <br>confusion that would be experienced by both consumers and cable operators if any portion of this order <br>happens to be overturned by a court after cable operators have taken the necessary steps to encrypt <br>service.  <br>
Despite these concerns and others, I vote to approve in part and concur in part to today’s order.  <br>
Furthermore, I thank the Chairman, my colleagues and our fine team in the Media Bureau for their <br>conscientious work on this matter.<br>

<p><b>COMMISSIONER AJIT PAI </b></p>
<p><b>APPROVING IN PART, CONCURRING IN PART</b></p>
<i>Re:  Basic Service Tier Encryption, MB Docket No. 11-169</i><br>
Today’s item is a win for consumers.  By updating our rules to keep pace with changing <br>
technology, cable operators will more often be able to activate and deactivate cable service remotely.  <br>This means that fewer Americans will have to rearrange their busy schedules for cable service <br>appointments.  It also means they will waste less time waiting for the “cable guy” to come to their homes.<br>
That said, there are some aspects of the item with which I do not agree; I would prefer a less <br>
complicated order with fewer conditions.  For example, I do not support the highly unusual non-<br>severability provision contained in paragraph 45.  The item does not explain why consumers should be <br>denied the benefits of basic-tier encryption if “any provision of the rules, or the application thereof to any <br>person or circumstance, are held to be unlawful or invalid.”  Indeed, if the application of <i>any </i>of the <br>conditions contained in this order are held to be invalid as applied to <i>any </i>circumstance, cable operators <br>apparently would be obligated to stop encrypting basic-tier signals even if they had already complied with <br>all of the conditions set forth in this item (<i>e.g.</i>, providing free set-top boxes, etc.).  The non-severability <br>provision thus seems both overbroad and unnecessary.<br>
Additionally, I believe that a policy judgment to extend the conditions pertaining to IP-enabled <br>
devices beyond their three-year term should be made by the Commission as a whole, rather than the <br>Bureau on delegated authority.<br>
Overall, however, I appreciate my colleagues’ willingness to improve the original version of this <br>
item.  In particular, it is important that consumers be provided with notice that clarifies how they will (or <br>will not) be impacted by basic-tier encryption, rather than confuses them.<br>
All in all, the benefits of this item clearly outweigh the drawbacks, so I am pleased to support it.  <br>
